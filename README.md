# Database and its Concepts

A computer database is an organized collection of electronic data designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation by authorized users. Similar in concept to traditional index cards but far more advanced, databases store only necessary, standardized data tailored to the needs of their users. Their size and complexity can range from simple home recipe collections to massive systems managing millions of customer transactions.
