# Database and its Concepts

A computer database is an organized collection of electronic data designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation by authorized users. Similar in concept to traditional index cards but far more advanced, databases store only necessary, standardized data tailored to the needs of their users. Their size and complexity can range from simple home recipe collections to massive systems managing millions of customer transactions.

A database contains only data relevant to its defined purpose, excluding any unnecessary or unrelated information. During its design, the intended use is clearly specified, ensuring all stored data is logically connected. For example, a library database would include information about loanable items and their details but not unrelated data like weather forecasts. This purposeful organization distinguishes a true database from random, unstructured data collections.

A database is designed with specific, known users in mind, as its purpose is to serve their needs. Identifying users is essential to determine what data should be stored. For instance, a library database is tailored for visitors and staff, providing information relevant to their requirements, such as item details and availability. This user-focused design distinguishes databases from random data collections.

Every database follows a specific data model that defines how data is stored, presented, and manipulated with precision. The model determines the structure of data units (records), their types, and the relationships between them, shaping how users view and interact with the data. It enables the creation of complex information by connecting simple data records through defined semantic relationships.
